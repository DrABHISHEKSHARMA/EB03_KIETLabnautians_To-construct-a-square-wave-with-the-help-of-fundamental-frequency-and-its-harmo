#### 1. Focus Area : Problem Based

By this experiment we want students to understand the concept of Continuous Time Fourier Series(CTFS). By doing this experiment they would themselves analyze that, how the addition of integer multiple of fundamental harmonics create a wave. The values of amplitude of the harmonics play a dominant role in the generation of periodic signal generation.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Describe the generation of periodic square wave with the help of CTFS | Remember | Describe
2.| User will be able to: <br>Describe the concept of Fourier Series | Understand | Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>Apply the concept of the Fourier Series for various periodic signal generation | Apply | Apply
4.| User will be able to: <br>Analyze the effect of the harmonics on any periodic signal generation | Analyse | Analyze

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem Based
###### Assessment Method: Summative

<u> <b>Description: </b></u>
<br>
 Students can enter the values of the amplitude values of the harmonics and change the entered values accordingly to obtain the periodic square wave. Students can match the obtained values of the harmonics with the theoretical values and obtained the errors.
Scope: Various runs of the same experiment are possible at changing values of flow rates, so that user may completely learn the objectives.
